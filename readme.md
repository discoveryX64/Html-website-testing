all this website is used for is testing various html things and my knowledge of html

[Website](https://discoveryx64.github.io/Html-website-testing/)

This website and more was made by replit (its so much easier to use than reg github or vsc lol)

Note: GitHub does delete some things to save up space on their end, so useless files will be deleted (such as alot of BS-Ico s)
